    "definitions": [
        "A grand division of the animal kingdom, intermediate, in some respects, between the invertebrates and vertebrates, and in modern classifications considered a subphylum of the vertebrates; called also urochordata. They were formerly classed with acephalous mollusks. The body is usually covered with a firm external tunic, consisting in part of cellulose, and having two openings, one for the entrance and one for the exit of water. The pharynx is usually dilated in the form of a sac, pierced by several series of ciliated slits, and serves as a gill."
