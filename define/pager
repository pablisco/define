        "A small electronic communication device which signals when a telephone call has been received at a base station. Each such device receives radio signals from the base station specifically coded for the individual to whom it is registered; the signal given by the device to the registered user may be a beeping sound, indicating that the user should call the base station to receive a message; or it may display a telephone number to which the user may call directly to return the incoming call, or may display a short message. Such devices are small enough to carry in the pocket or pocketbook, or to clip onto a belt or other part of the clothing. Also called beeper."
