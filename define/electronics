    "definitions": [
        "the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of electrons. Electronics is primarily concerned with phenomena other than simple conduction, such as emission of electrons, storage of electrical charge, the effects of electrical fields on the conduction of electrons through a circuit, and amplification and manipulation of electric signals such as voltage or current by design of circuits. Electronics also encompasses the application of such fundamental principles to the construction of devices using the manipulation of electrons in their operation, known as electronic devices.",
        "the branch of engineering concerned with design of devices using the principles of electronics, for practical purposes.",
        "electronic devices generally, or the electronic circuits within an electronic device."
