    "word": "Soap",
    "definitions": [
        "A substance which dissolves in water, thus forming a lather, and is used as a cleansing agent. Soap is produced by combining fats or oils with alkalies or alkaline earths, usually by boiling, and consists of salts of sodium, potassium, etc., with the fatty acids (oleic, stearic, palmitic, etc.). See the Note below, and cf. Saponification. By extension, any compound of similar composition or properties, whether used as a cleaning agent or not.",
        "To rub or wash over with soap.",
        "To flatter; to wheedle."
    ],
    "examples": [
        "The purifying action of soap depends upon the fact that it is decomposed by a large quantity of water into free alkali and an insoluble acid salt. The first of these takes away the fatty dirt on washing, and the latter forms the soap lather which envelops the greasy matter and thus tends to remove it.",
        "This soap bubble of the metaphysicians."
    ],
    "etymology": "[OE. sope, AS. s; akin to D. zeep, G. seife, OHG. seifa, Icel. s, Sw. s, Dan. s, and perhaps to AS. s to drip, MHG. s, and L. sebum tallow. Cf. Saponaceous.]"
