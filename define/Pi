        "The letter pi, to twenty decimal places, is 3.14159265358979323846 (see note). The number pi is an irrational number, i.e. it cannot be expressed as the quotient of two integers. It is also a transcendental number, i.e. it cannot be expressed as a root of an algebraic equation with a finite number of terms; and from this fact follows the impossibility of the quadrature of the circle by purely algebraic processes, or by the aid of a ruler and compass.",
