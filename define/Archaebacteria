    "definitions": [
        "A group of single-celled microorganisms including the methanogens and some halophiles and thermoacidophiles, recognized in the 1970's by C. R. Woese and his colleagues as being a distinct group on the basis of RNA sequences, cell walls, and coenzymes differing from those of other microbes. It is believed to be an ancient form of living organism that evolved separately from the eubacteria and blue-green algae. It is classified as a separate kingdom by some taxonomists. See also The Archaebacteria."
