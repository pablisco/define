    ],
    "examples": [
        "The family . . . is alternately known as the nightjars (derived from the \"churring\" sounds of several species -- \"jarring\" the night air), or goatsuckers, a nonsense name that should be discontinued as it has its origin in the preposterous myth that the birds sucked the milk of nanny goats until they were dry."
