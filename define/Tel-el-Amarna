A collection of about 300 clay tablets (called the Tel-el-Amarna tablets, or the Amarna tablets) was found here, forming the diplomatic correspondence (Tel-el-Amarna letters) of Amenophis IV. and his father, Amenophis III., with the kings of Asiatic countries (such as Babylonia, Assyria, and Palestine), written in cuneiform characters. It is an important source of our knowledge of Asia from about 1400 to 1370 b. c.. The name of the site is also spelled Tell-el-Amarna, Tell el Amarna, and Tel Amarna."
