    "word": "Roller coaster",
    "definitions": [
        "An amusement railroad of varying design in which open cars coast by gravity over a long winding track in a closed circuit, with steep pitches and ascents, and in some cases loops in which the cars are briefly upside-down; typically, the cars are pulled by a chain device to the top of the first peak, after which gravity and momentum provide the only propulsive forces. In some cases, the cars are suspended from a monorail rather than resting on a track, and such cars may be made to swing outward at an angle near to the horizontal. It is a popular amusement at many amusement parks, but is sufficiently frightening to some people that they refuse to ride in one."
