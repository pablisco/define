        "A prolongation or increase of any sound, either by reflection, as in a cavern or apartment the walls of which are not distant enough to return a distinct echo, or by the production of vibrations in other bodies, as a sounding-board, or the bodies of musical instruments.",
        "A phenomenon in which a vibration or other cyclic process (such as tide cycles) of large amplitude is produced by smaller impulses, when the frequency of the external impulses is close to that of the natural cycling frequency of the process in that system.",
        "An electric phenomenon corresponding to that of acoustic resonance, due to the existance of certain relations of the capacity, inductance, resistance, and frequency of an alternating circuit; the tuning of a radio transmitter or receiver to send or detect waves of specific frequencies depends on this phenomenon."
