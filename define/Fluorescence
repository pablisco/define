    "word": "Fluorescence",
    "definitions": [
        "A luminescence emitted by certain substances due to the absorption of radiation at one wavelength, and the almost instantaneous re-emission of radiation at another, usually longer wavelength. The re-radiation stops almost as soon as the incident radiation is halted, thus distinguishing this phenomenon from phosphorescence, in which re-radiation of light may continue for some time after the incident radiation is halted."
