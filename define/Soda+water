    "word": "Soda water",
    "definitions": [
        "originally, a beverage consisting of a weak solution of sodium bicarbonate to which an acid (such as phosphoric acid) has been added to generate carbon dioxide and thus cause effervescence; the term now is also used as a synonym for soda pop. Soda water without flavoring is used as a beverage or as a component of a mixed beverage. It is typically bottled or canned under pressure so that the carbon dioxide and effervescence will be preserved until use.",
        "a beverage containing supersaturated carbon dioxide (carbonic acid) and thus effervescent.",
