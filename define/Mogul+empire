        "The empire created in India by invading Mongolians (Tatars), established under Baber, who conquered Hindustan in 1526. The established religion of the empire was Islam. After the death of the Great Mogul Aurung-Zeb in 1707, power passed to the Mahrattas and the British. The empire existed only nominally in the early 1800's, and was finally abolished in 1857 by the deposing of the last emperor."
