    "word": "Liquid",
    "definitions": [
        "Being in such a state that the component molecules move freely among themselves, but have a definite volume changing only slightly with changes of pressure, and do not tend to separate from each other as the particles of gases and vapors do when the volume of the container is increased; neither solid nor gaseous; as, liquid mercury, in distinction from mercury solidified or in a state of vapor.",
        "Flowing or sounding smoothly or without abrupt transitions or harsh tones.",
        "Pronounced without any jar or harshness; smooth; as, l and r are liquid letters.",
        "Fluid and transparent; as, the liquid air.",
        "Clear; definite in terms or amount.",
        "In cash or readily convertible into cash without loss of principle; -- said of assets, such as bank accounts, or short-term bonds tradable on a major stock exchange.",
        "A substance whose parts change their relative position on the slightest pressure, and therefore retain no definite form; any substance in the state of liquidity; a fluid that is not gaseous and has a definite volume independent, of the container in which it is held. Liquids have a fixed volume at any given pressure, but their shape is determined by the container in which it is contained. Liquids, in contrast to gases, cannot expand indefinitely to fill an expanding container, and are only slightly compressible by application of pressure.",
        "A letter which has a smooth, flowing sound, or which flows smoothly after a mute; as, l and r, in bla, bra. M and n also are called liquids."
