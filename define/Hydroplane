        "a powered surface boat fitted with planes (hydroplanes{2}) projecting below the hull, designed to lift the boat, when moving rapidly, so that the hull itself is lifted out of the water and the boat is supported by the hydrodynamic forces of the water on the hydroplanes{2}, thus permitting higher speeds; formerly called a gliding boat.",
        "Of a boat, to move through water while supported by hydroplanes{3} (see hydroplane{3}, above).",
        "to move through a body of water supported by the hydrodynamic forces on a surface, similar in principle to a hydroplane{3}; -- said, e. .g, of automobiles skidding on a shallow patch of water on a road when moving at high speed, thus causing the tires to lose contact with the road surface."
