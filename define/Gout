It consists in an inflammation of the fibrous and ligamentous parts of the joints, and almost always attacks first the great toe, next the smaller joints, after which it may attack the greater articulations. It is attended with various sympathetic phenomena, particularly in the digestive organs. It may also attack internal organs, as the stomach, the intestines, etc. It is an inherited disease of purine metaboism, which causes an increased level of uric acid in the blood, and leads to deposition of crystals of sodium urate in cartilage within joints and in connective tissue. It can be alleviated by a diet low in purines, and is treated by drugs which block formation of uric acid.",
