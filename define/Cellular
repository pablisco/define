        "porous; containing cavities.",
        "pertaining to or using a system of transmission of telephone signals by radio, in which areas are divided into geographical parts (cells), each of which is served by a transmitter whose range is limited to that region, thus permitting a single transmission frequency to be used simulataneously in different parts of the same area. Cellular telephones are typically small and battery powered, allowing a subscriber with such a telephone to carry the telephone in a pocket or purse, over the entire area served, and to be contacted by a single telephone number. The system became widespread and popular in the 1980's and 1990's; as, cellular telephones sometimes lose their link unpredictably."
