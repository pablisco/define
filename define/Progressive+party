    "definitions": [
        "The political party formed, chiefly out of the Republican party, by the adherents of Theodore Roosevelt in the presidential campaign of 1912. The name Progressive party was chosen at the meeting held on Aug. 7, 1912, when the candidates were nominated and the platform adopted. It was also known as the Bull Moose Party. Among the chief articles in the platform are those demanding direct primaries, preferential primaries for presidential nominations, direct election of United States senators, women's suffrage, and recall of judicial decisions in certain cases. In 1924 the label was also adopted by the party supporting the presidential campaign of Robert M. La Follette, and in 1948 it was also adopted by the party of Henry Wallace. The party is no longer (1998) considered a force in U. S. national politics."
