        "Wrought and wreaked havoc Recently, we mentioned that something had wreaked havoc with our PC. We were fairly quickly corrected by someone who said, \"Shouldn't that be wrought havoc?\" The answer is no, because either wreaked or wrought is fine here. A misconception often arises because wrought is wrongly assumed to be the past participle of wreak. In fact wrought is the past participle of an early version of the word work! Wreak comes from Old English wrecan \"drive out, punish, avenge\", which derives ultimately from the Indo-European root *wreg- \"push, shove, drive, track down\". Latin urgere \"to urge\" comes from the same source, giving English urge. Interestingly, wreak is also related to wrack and wreck. The phrase wreak havoc was first used by Agatha Christie in 1923. Wrought, on the other hand, arose in the 13th century as the past participle of wirchen, Old English for \"work\". In the 15th century worked came into use as the past participle of work, but wrought survived in such phrases as finely-wrought, hand-wrought, and, of course, wrought havoc . . . . Havoc, by the way, comes from Anglo-French havok, which derived from the phrase crier havot \"to cry havoc\". This meant \"to give the army the order to begin seizing spoil, or to pillage\". It is thought that this exclamation was Germanic in origin, but that's all that anyone will say about it! The destruction associated with pillaging came to be applied metaphorically to havoc, giving the word its current meaning."
