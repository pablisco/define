    "word": "Amyl alcohol",
    "definitions": [
        "Any of eight isomeric liquid alcohols (C5H11.OH), transparent, colorless liquids. It is the hydroxide of amyl. Also called amylic alcohol. The amyl alcohol obtained from fusel oil is mostly isoamyl alcohol (3-methyl-1-butanol or 1-hydroxy-3-methylbutane), with some sec-amyl alcohol (2-methyl-1-butanol or 2-pentanol), and has a characteristic peculiar odor. Other than n-amyl alcohol (also called 1-pentanol) the other isomeric pentanols are not usually refered to as amyl alcohol. The amyl alcohol mixture in fusel oil forms a colorless liquid with a peculiar cough-exciting odor and burning taste. It is used as a source of amyl compounds, such as amyl acetate, amyl nitrite, etc."
