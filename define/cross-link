    "word": "cross-link",
    "definitions": [
        "a covalent bond that links two chains of atoms, or two sections of one chain, in a polymeric molecule; the cross-link is created by a third bond in a monomer unit in addition to the two bonds forming the polymeric chain; -- a cross-link may be internal to a single chain, rather than between two otherwise unlinked chains; as, ultraviolet irradiation creates cross-links between the two chains of a DNA double helix; many enzymes have cross-links formed by disulfide bonds; polystyrene resins have their porosity controlled by the proportion of cross-links. Called also cross-linkage.",
        "to create cross links in; -- of polymeric molecules."
