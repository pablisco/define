    "definitions": [
        "An establishment, usually commercial, where the bodies of dead persons are prepared for viewing before burial or cremation; called also funeral parlor, mortuary, funeral chapel and informally, undertaker's. The body may or may not be preserved by embalming before viewing or burial, and in some cases the body is not exposed for viewing, though present in a casket. Often, some form of memorial service is held for the deceased at the funeral home, where friends and relatives may come to pay their respects to the dead, and express condolence to the family. The work of preparation of the body and many other arrangements related to the funeral and burial are carried out by an undertaker or mortician who manages the funeral home."
