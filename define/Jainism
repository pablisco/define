        "The heterodox Hindu religion, founded in the 6th century as a revolt against Hinduism; its most striking features are the exaltation of saints or holy mortals, called jins, above the ordinary Hindu gods, and the denial of a supreme being and of the divine origin and infallibility of the Vedas. Also, the sect comprising those adhering to Jainism. Jainism believes in immortality and the transmigration of the soul. It is intermediate between Brahmanism and Buddhism, having some things in common with each."
