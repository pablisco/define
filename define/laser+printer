        "A printer controlled by a computer, using a laser beam to produce images in a fine dot-matrix pattern of charge on an electrostatic drum, to which fine particles of ink are subsequently caused to adhere, and the image of which is subsequently transferred to paper or another type of material in sheet form. It is capable of high-speed production of images with a higher resolution than those from dot-matrix impact printers."
