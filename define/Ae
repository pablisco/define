        "A diphthong in the Latin language; used also by the Saxon writers. It corresponds to the Gr. ai. The Anglo-Saxon short was generally replaced by a, the long e or ee. In derivatives from Latin words with ae, it is mostly superseded by e. For most words found with this initial combination, the reader will therefore search under the letter E."
